# meet

This is a simple PWA that functions similar to meetup in that it provides the following features:

As a user,
I should be able to filter events by city
So that I can see the list of events that take place in that city.

As a user
I should be able to click on an event
So that I can see more or less details about that event.

As a user
I should be able to select how many events I want to see
So that I can choose the number of events on screen at a time.

As a user,
I should be able to use the app when offline
So that I donâ€™t need internet access to see the events I was viewing previously

As a user,
I should be able to see a visualization of the events in the different cities
So that I can easily see which cities are the most hoppin.
